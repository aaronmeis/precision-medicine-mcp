TEST 4: Histology and Imaging Analysis
=======================================

Patient ID: PAT001-OVC-2025

⚠️ IMPORTANT: This test uses MICROSCOPY IMAGES (TIFF files).
- H&E images use BRIGHTFIELD microscopy (chromogenic stains)
- IF images use FLUORESCENCE microscopy (fluorescent antibodies)
Use openimagedata and deepcell servers to read and analyze images.

## Imaging Analysis (use mcp-openimagedata and mcp-deepcell)

For patient PAT001-OVC-2025, analyze histology and immunofluorescence images:

### Data Files Location:
Files are in: `patient-data/PAT001-OVC-2025/imaging/`
- PAT001_tumor_HE_20x.tiff (BRIGHTFIELD H&E)
- PAT001_tumor_IF_CD8.tiff (FLUORESCENCE)
- PAT001_tumor_IF_KI67.tiff (FLUORESCENCE)
- PAT001_tumor_multiplex_IF_TP53_KI67_DAPI.tiff (FLUORESCENCE - 3 channels)

### Analysis Steps:

1. **H&E Histology Analysis (use openimagedata):**
   Load PAT001_tumor_HE_20x.tiff
   - This is a BRIGHTFIELD image with chromogenic stains (NOT fluorescence)
   - Hematoxylin stains nuclei blue, Eosin stains cytoplasm pink
   - Describe tissue architecture (glandular patterns, cell density)
   - Are there necrotic regions visible (pale/acellular areas)? (Expect: Yes)
   - Estimate tumor cellularity percentage using visual assessment (Expect: ~70-80%)
   - Overall tissue morphology consistent with HGSOC?

2. **Immunofluorescence - CD8 T Cell Infiltration (use openimagedata + deepcell):**
   Load PAT001_tumor_IF_CD8.tiff
   - This is a FLUORESCENCE image (NOT H&E)
   - Use deepcell to segment nuclei and identify CD8+ cells
   - Quantify CD8+ T cells (cells/mm²)
   - Spatial distribution: Periphery vs infiltrating?
   - Expected: LOW infiltration (~5-15 cells/mm²), primarily at periphery (immune exclusion)

3. **Immunofluorescence - Ki67 Proliferation (use openimagedata + deepcell):**
   Load PAT001_tumor_IF_KI67.tiff
   - This is a FLUORESCENCE image (NOT H&E)
   - Use deepcell to segment cells and identify Ki67+ nuclei
   - Calculate Ki67 proliferation index (% positive cells)
   - Is proliferation uniform or heterogeneous across tissue?
   - Expected: HIGH proliferation (~45-55%), heterogeneous

4. **Multiplex Immunofluorescence (use openimagedata + deepcell):**
   Load PAT001_tumor_multiplex_IF_TP53_KI67_DAPI.tiff
   - This is a FLUORESCENCE multiplex image with 3 channels:
     * Channel 1 (Red): TP53 (mutant p53 accumulation)
     * Channel 2 (Green): KI67 (proliferation marker)
     * Channel 3 (Blue): DAPI (nuclear stain)
   - Use deepcell to segment cells based on DAPI channel
   - Quantify marker expression per cell:
     * TP53+ cells (% of total)
     * KI67+ cells (% of total)
     * TP53+/KI67+ double-positive cells (% of total)
   - Are TP53-mutant cells also highly proliferative?

## Expected Results:

**H&E Morphology:**
- Cellularity: 70-80% tumor cells
- Architecture: High-grade serous features (solid and glandular patterns)
- Necrosis: Present in ~15-20% of tissue
- Nuclear atypia: Marked (high-grade)

**CD8 T Cell Infiltration:**
- Density: LOW (~5-15 cells/mm²)
- Distribution: Predominantly at tumor periphery (stromal interface)
- Infiltration: MINIMAL intratumoral CD8+ cells
- Interpretation: **Immune exclusion phenotype**

**Ki67 Proliferation Index:**
- Ki67 index: HIGH (~45-55% positive cells)
- Distribution: Heterogeneous (higher in tumor_proliferative regions)
- Pattern: Consistent with aggressive HGSOC

**Multiplex IF Cell Segmentation:**
- Total cells segmented: ~500-800 cells
- TP53+ cells: ~65-75% (mutant p53 accumulation)
- KI67+ cells: ~45-55% (high proliferation)
- TP53+/KI67+ double-positive: ~40-50%
- Interpretation: TP53-mutant cells are highly proliferative

## Output Format:

Please provide:

1. **H&E Summary:**
   - Estimated cellularity: XX%
   - Necrotic regions: Present/Absent (XX% of tissue)
   - Tissue architecture description
   - Consistent with HGSOC diagnosis? (Yes/No)

2. **CD8 T Cell Analysis:**
   - CD8+ cell density: XX cells/mm²
   - Spatial pattern: Periphery vs Infiltrating
   - Immune phenotype: Hot/Warm/Cold?

3. **Ki67 Proliferation:**
   - Ki67 index: XX% positive
   - Distribution pattern: Uniform vs Heterogeneous
   - Proliferation level: High/Medium/Low

4. **Multiplex IF Results:**
   - Total cells segmented: XXX
   - TP53+: XX%
   - KI67+: XX%
   - TP53+/KI67+: XX%
   - Correlation: Are TP53+ cells proliferating? (Yes/No)

5. **Overall Imaging Interpretation:**
   - Is this a highly proliferative tumor? (Yes)
   - Is there immune exclusion? (Yes)
   - Does imaging support molecular findings? (Yes)
   - Implications for immunotherapy? (Limited efficacy expected)

## Validation Checkpoints:

✅ Loaded: 4 imaging files (H&E, CD8, Ki67, multiplex IF)
✅ H&E: High cellularity (~70-80%), necrosis present
✅ CD8: Low infiltration (~5-15 cells/mm²), immune exclusion
