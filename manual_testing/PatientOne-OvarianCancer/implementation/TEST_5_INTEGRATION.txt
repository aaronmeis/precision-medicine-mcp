TEST 5: Integrated Analysis & Clinical Recommendations
=======================================================

Patient ID: PAT001-OVC-2025

⚠️ NOTE: Run this test AFTER completing Tests 1-4

This test synthesizes findings from all previous tests - NO new data loading required.

## Integration & Clinical Recommendations

Based on the findings from Tests 1-4, please synthesize a comprehensive clinical report.

### Reference Results from Previous Tests:

**TEST 1 - Clinical & Genomic:**
- Patient: Sarah Anderson, 58yo, BRCA1 germline mutation
- CA-125 trajectory: 1456 → 22 → 389 → 289 U/mL (platinum resistance)
- Somatic mutations: TP53 R175H, PIK3CA E545K, PTEN LOH
- TCGA subtype: C1/C2 (poor prognosis with Stage IV + resistance)

**TEST 2 - Multi-Omics:**
- PI3K/AKT pathway: ACTIVATED across RNA/Protein/Phospho
- Key genes dysregulated: PIK3CA, AKT1, MTOR (up); PTEN (down)
- Drug resistance: ABCB1 upregulated (MDR1 efflux pump)
- Anti-apoptotic: BCL2L1 upregulated

**TEST 3 - Spatial Transcriptomics:**
- 900 spots across 6 regions
- Resistance markers: Concentrated in tumor regions (heterogeneous)
- Immune cells: EXCLUDED from tumor (located in stroma_immune region)
- Tumor microenvironment: Immunologically "COLD"

**TEST 4 - Imaging:**
- High proliferation (Ki67 ~45-55%)
- Low CD8+ infiltration (~5-15 cells/mm²)
- TP53-mutant cells are highly proliferative
- Immune exclusion phenotype confirmed

## Analysis Questions:

### 1. PRIMARY RESISTANCE MECHANISMS (Rank by Evidence Strength)

Based on ALL modalities (genomics, multi-omics, spatial, imaging), identify the 2-3 main mechanisms driving platinum resistance in this patient.

For each mechanism, provide:
- **Mechanism name**
- **Supporting evidence** (which tests/modalities show this?)
- **Strength of evidence** (High/Medium/Low)
- **Therapeutic implications**

Expected top mechanisms:
1. PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation
2. Drug efflux (ABCB1/MDR1)
3. Anti-apoptotic signaling (BCL2L1)
4. TP53 loss of function

### 2. MULTI-MODAL CONSISTENCY

Which molecular alterations appear consistently across multiple data types?

Create a cross-reference table:

| Feature | Genomics | Multi-Omics | Spatial | Imaging | Consistent? |
|---------|----------|-------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| TP53 mutation/loss | TP53 R175H | ? | ? | TP53+ cells | Yes/No |
| PI3K/AKT activation | PIK3CA E545K | PIK3CA/AKT1 up | ? | ? | Yes/No |
| High proliferation | ? | ? | MKI67 high | Ki67 high | Yes/No |
| Immune exclusion | ? | ? | CD8 in stroma | CD8 at periphery | Yes/No |

### 3. THERAPEUTIC RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the integrated data, provide:

**A. Targeted Therapy Recommendations (Top 3):**

For each recommendation:
- **Drug/class**
- **Molecular target**
- **Supporting evidence** (from which tests?)
- **Expected efficacy** (High/Medium/Low)
- **FDA approval status** for HGSOC

Expected recommendations should include:
- PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors (e.g., alpelisib + olaparib)
- MDR1 inhibitors or chemotherapy modifications
- BCL2L1 inhibitors (if available)
- PARP inhibitors (BRCA1 mutation)

**B. Immunotherapy Consideration:**

- Should checkpoint inhibitors be considered? (Yes/No)
- Why or why not? (Cite spatial and imaging evidence)
- Expected response rate based on immune phenotype
- Could combination with other agents overcome exclusion?

**C. Clinical Trial Opportunities:**

For BRCA1-mutant, platinum-resistant, Stage IV HGSOC with:
- PI3K/AKT pathway activation
- Immune exclusion phenotype
- High proliferation

Suggest trial types:
- PARP + PI3K/AKT inhibitor combinations
- Novel immunotherapy combinations
- BRCA-targeted therapies

### 4. BIOMARKERS FOR MONITORING

**A. Molecular Biomarkers:**
- Which genes/proteins should be tracked for treatment response?
- How often should they be monitored?
- What change indicates resistance?

**B. Imaging Biomarkers:**
- Which imaging features predict resistance?
- Can spatial transcriptomics track treatment response?
- Should Ki67 or immune infiltration be monitored?

**C. Clinical Biomarkers:**
- CA-125 trends (what trajectory indicates response vs resistance?)
- RECIST criteria
- Circulating tumor DNA
