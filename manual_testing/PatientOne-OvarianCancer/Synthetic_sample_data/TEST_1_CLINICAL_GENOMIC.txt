TEST 1: Clinical Data and Genomic Analysis
===========================================

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Use EXISTING files in:
/Users/lynnlangit/Documents/GitHub/spatial-mcp/manual_testing/PatientOne-OvarianCancer/Synthetic_sample_data/

Patient ID: PAT001-OVC-2025

## PART 1: Clinical Data (mcp-mockepic)

1. READ THE EXISTING FILE: clinical/patient_demographics.json
   - What is the patient's name, age, and family history?
   - What genetic mutations are noted?

2. READ THE EXISTING FILE: clinical/lab_results.json
   - Show the CA-125 trend over time
   - What does the trend indicate about platinum resistance?

## PART 2: Genomic Analysis (mcp-fgbio, mcp-tcga)

3. READ THE EXISTING FILE: genomics/somatic_variants.vcf
   - What are the key mutations? (Look for TP53, PIK3CA, PTEN)
   - What copy number alterations are present?

4. Compare to TCGA-OV cohort (mcp-tcga):
   - What molecular subtype does this match?
   - What is the prognosis for BRCA1-mutant, TP53-mutant Stage IV HGSOC?
   - What pathways are commonly activated in similar cases?

## Output:
Please provide a summary of:
1. Patient demographics and genetic risk
2. CA-125 trajectory showing resistance
3. Key somatic mutations found
4. TCGA comparison and pathway activation
