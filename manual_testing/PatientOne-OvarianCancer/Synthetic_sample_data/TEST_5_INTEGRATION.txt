TEST 5: Integrated Analysis & Recommendations
==============================================

⚠️ NOTE: Run this test AFTER completing Tests 1-4

Patient ID: PAT001-OVC-2025

## Integration & Recommendations

Based on the findings from Tests 1-4, please synthesize:

1. **PRIMARY RESISTANCE MECHANISMS:**
   From all modalities (genomics, multi-omics, spatial, imaging), what are the 2-3 main mechanisms driving platinum resistance?

2. **CONSISTENT FINDINGS:**
   Which molecular alterations appear across multiple data types?
   - Genomics (VCF): TP53 R175H, PIK3CA E545K
   - Multi-omics: Which genes dysregulated in all 3 modalities?
   - Spatial: Where are resistance markers expressed?
   - Imaging: Does proliferation/immune landscape support the molecular findings?

3. **THERAPEUTIC RECOMMENDATIONS:**
   Based on the integrated data:
   - Top 3 targeted therapy recommendations with rationale
   - Should immunotherapy be considered? Why or why not?
   - Clinical trial opportunities for BRCA-mutant, platinum-resistant HGSOC

4. **BIOMARKERS FOR MONITORING:**
   - Which molecular features should be tracked for treatment response?
   - Which spatial or imaging features predict resistance?

## Output Format:
Please provide a concise 1-2 page report with:
- Executive summary (3-4 sentences)
- Resistance mechanisms (ranked by evidence strength)
- Treatment recommendations (ranked by expected efficacy)
- Monitoring strategy
