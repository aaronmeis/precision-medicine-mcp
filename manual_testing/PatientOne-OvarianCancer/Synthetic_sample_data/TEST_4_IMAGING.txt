TEST 4: Histology and Imaging Analysis
=======================================

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Use EXISTING files in:
/Users/lynnlangit/Documents/GitHub/spatial-mcp/manual_testing/PatientOne-OvarianCancer/Synthetic_sample_data/

Patient ID: PAT001-OVC-2025

## Imaging Analysis (mcp-openimagedata, mcp-deepcell)

1. READ THE EXISTING IMAGE: imaging/PAT001_tumor_HE_20x.tiff
   - Describe the tissue architecture
   - Are there necrotic regions?
   - Estimate tumor cellularity

2. READ THE EXISTING IMAGE: imaging/PAT001_tumor_IF_CD8.tiff
   - Quantify CD8+ T cell infiltration
   - Are CD8+ cells at the tumor periphery or infiltrating?

3. READ THE EXISTING IMAGE: imaging/PAT001_tumor_IF_KI67.tiff
   - What is the Ki67 proliferation index?
   - Is proliferation uniform or heterogeneous?

4. READ THE EXISTING IMAGE: imaging/PAT001_tumor_multiplex_IF_TP53_KI67_DAPI.tiff
   - This is a 3-channel image (TP53=red, KI67=green, DAPI=blue)
   - Segment cells and identify phenotypes
   - What percentage of cells are TP53+? KI67+?
   - Are TP53+ cells also proliferating (KI67+)?

## Output:
Please provide:
1. H&E summary (cellularity, necrosis, architecture)
2. CD8 quantification (cells/mm², spatial distribution)
3. Ki67 index (% positive cells)
4. Multiplex IF analysis (cell counts by phenotype)
5. Overall interpretation: Is this a highly proliferative, immune-excluded tumor?
