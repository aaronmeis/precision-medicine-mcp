TEST 2: Multi-Omics Resistance Analysis
========================================

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Use EXISTING files in:
/Users/lynnlangit/Documents/GitHub/spatial-mcp/manual_testing/PatientOne-OvarianCancer/Synthetic_sample_data/

Patient ID: PAT001-OVC-2025

## Multi-Omics Analysis (mcp-multiomics)

1. READ THE EXISTING FILE: multiomics/sample_metadata.csv
   - How many resistant vs sensitive samples are there?

2. For KEY RESISTANCE GENES ONLY (to keep context small):
   - PI3K/AKT pathway: AKT1, PIK3CA, MTOR, PTEN
   - Drug resistance: ABCB1
   - Anti-apoptotic: BCL2L1

3. READ these genes from the EXISTING FILES:
   - multiomics/pdx_rna_seq.csv (just the genes listed above)
   - multiomics/pdx_proteomics.csv (just the genes listed above)
   - multiomics/pdx_phosphoproteomics.csv (just the genes listed above)

4. Run Stouffer's meta-analysis (mcp-multiomics):
   - Compare resistant vs sensitive samples for these 6 genes
   - Use directionality from effect sizes
   - Apply FDR correction (α = 0.05)
   - Which genes are significantly dysregulated across all three modalities?

## Output:
Please provide:
1. Sample counts (7 resistant, 8 sensitive)
2. For each of the 6 genes:
   - Expression pattern in RNA/Protein/Phospho
   - Stouffer's combined Z-score
   - FDR-adjusted p-value
   - Interpretation
3. Which pathway (PI3K/AKT) is activated in resistant samples?
