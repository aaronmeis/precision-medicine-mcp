TEST 3: Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis
=========================================

Patient ID: PAT001-OVC-2025

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Data has been copied to MCP-accessible location. Use spatialtools server to read files.

## Spatial Analysis (use mcp-spatialtools)

For patient PAT001-OVC-2025, analyze spatial gene expression patterns:

### Data Files Location:
Files are in: `patient-data/PAT001-OVC-2025/spatial/`
- visium_spatial_coordinates.csv
- visium_gene_expression.csv
- visium_region_annotations.csv

### Analysis Steps:

1. **Load spatial data:**
   - How many spatial spots? (Expect: 900)
   - What spatial regions are identified? (Expect: 6 regions)
   - How many spots per region?

2. **Focus on KEY GENES ONLY** (8 genes to reduce context):
   - **Proliferation:** MKI67, PCNA
   - **Resistance:** PIK3CA, AKT1, ABCB1
   - **Immune:** CD3D, CD8A, CD68

3. **Gene expression by region:**
   - Which regions have high proliferation (MKI67, PCNA)?
   - Where are resistance markers (PIK3CA, AKT1, ABCB1) expressed?
   - Where are immune cells (CD3D, CD8A, CD68) located?

4. **Spatial patterns:**
   - Is there spatial heterogeneity in resistance markers?
   - Are immune cells excluded from tumor regions?
   - Tumor-stroma interface patterns?

## Expected Results:

**Spatial Structure:**
- Total spots: 900
- Regions: 6
  1. tumor_core (~69 spots)
  2. tumor_proliferative (~124 spots)
  3. tumor_interface (~112 spots)
  4. stroma_immune (~212 spots)
  5. stroma (~180 spots)
  6. necrotic_hypoxic (~203 spots)

**Expression Patterns:**

| Gene | High Expression Region | Pattern |
|------|----------------------|---------|
| MKI67 | tumor_proliferative | High proliferation |
| PCNA | tumor_proliferative | High proliferation |
| PIK3CA | tumor_core, tumor_proliferative | Resistance mechanism |
| AKT1 | tumor regions | PI3K/AKT pathway |
| ABCB1 | tumor regions | Drug efflux |
| CD3D | stroma_immune | T cells |
| CD8A | stroma_immune | Cytotoxic T cells |
| CD68 | stroma_immune | Macrophages |

**Spatial Findings:**
- Proliferation: Highest in tumor_proliferative region
- Resistance markers: Concentrated in tumor regions (heterogeneous)
- Immune cells: Primarily in stroma_immune region (EXCLUDED from tumor)
- Tumor microenvironment: Immunologically "cold" (immune exclusion)

## Output Format:

Please provide:

1. **Spatial Structure:**
   - Total spots: 900
   - Region breakdown with spot counts
   - Visual description of tissue layout

2. **Gene Expression Heatmap:**
   - 8 genes × 6 regions
   - Which genes are high/low in each region?

3. **Key Spatial Findings:**
   - Where is proliferation highest?
   - Resistance marker distribution pattern
   - Immune cell localization

4. **Clinical Interpretation:**
   - Is there spatial heterogeneity in resistance markers? (Yes)
   - Are immune cells excluded from tumor? (Yes)
   - Tumor microenvironment classification: Cold vs Hot? (Cold)
   - Implications for immunotherapy? (Limited efficacy expected)

## Validation Checkpoints:

✅ Loaded: 900 spots across 6 regions
✅ Proliferation: High in tumor_proliferative region
✅ Resistance markers: Present in tumor regions
✅ Immune cells: Localized to stroma_immune region
✅ Immune exclusion: Confirmed (immune cells away from tumor)
✅ Heterogeneity: Spatial variation in resistance markers
