TEST 3: Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis
=========================================

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Use EXISTING files in:
/Users/lynnlangit/Documents/GitHub/spatial-mcp/manual_testing/PatientOne-OvarianCancer/Synthetic_sample_data/

Patient ID: PAT001-OVC-2025

## Spatial Analysis (mcp-spatialtools)

1. READ THE EXISTING FILE: spatial/visium_region_annotations.csv
   - How many spatial spots are there?
   - What are the different spatial regions identified?
   - How many spots in each region?

2. READ THE EXISTING FILE: spatial/visium_gene_expression.csv
   - Focus on these KEY GENES only:
     * Proliferation: MKI67, PCNA
     * Resistance: PIK3CA, AKT1, ABCB1
     * Immune: CD3D, CD8A, CD68
   - What is the expression pattern of these genes across the 6 regions?

3. Spatial heterogeneity analysis:
   - Where are resistance markers (PIK3CA, AKT1, ABCB1) most highly expressed?
   - Where are immune cells (CD3D, CD8A, CD68) located?
   - Is there immune exclusion from tumor regions?

## Output:
Please provide:
1. Region summary (6 regions, spot counts)
2. Expression heatmap showing the 8 genes across 6 regions
3. Key findings about resistance marker distribution
4. Key findings about immune cell localization
5. Interpretation: Is the tumor immunologically "cold" or "hot"?
